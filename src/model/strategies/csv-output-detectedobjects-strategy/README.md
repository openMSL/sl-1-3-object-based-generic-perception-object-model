# CSV Output Strategy for Detected Objects

This strategy writes OSI3::DetectedMovingObjects in a csv file.
Path for the file is set via CMakeLists.

You need to add the name of the strategy in a new line in the *csv_output_sequence.conf* file in the *src/model/strategies/* folder.

In order for the strategy to be called during simulation, the FMI parameter *switch_for_csv_output* needs to be set to *1* and be passed to the framework or model fmu.
